# RMWatcher

## Description

**RMWatcher** is a simple Windows utility (written in C#) for periodically checking for updates to Reddit posts that contain magnet and/or torrent links (useful where RSS won't work). If a post is updated, RMWatcher automatically opens the magnet or `.torrent` link with your associated app.
